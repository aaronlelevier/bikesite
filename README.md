Repo with code relating to MTB

## Projects

#### Get Bike info and Geometry stats from [VitalMTB](https://www.vitalmtb.com/)

There is a single Jupyter notebook with exploratory code that fetches the bike stats and geometry from a bike-specs page on VitalMTB

This is done using [beautifulsoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) in Python3.

**Next Step**

The next step would be to convert the exploratory code into a script that takes the URL of the VitalMTB bike page for the bike we want the info for, and writes the stats to an ouput file

# Future Maybe

#### Bike Geo Comparator

A UI could exist that takes the geometry numbers for two bikes and creates a SVG for each bike and overlaps them to show how the bike Geo varies

This could also show the Geo values in a table with the difference
